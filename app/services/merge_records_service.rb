  # This service is intended to merge duplicate records.

  # Example:
  #     old_reference:  Person.where(name: "Joel Conway").first
  #     new_reference:  Person.where(name: "Conway, Joel").first
  #
  # In this example, the service will find all objects with
  # references to "Joel Conway", and replace those references
  # with "Conway, Joel", and then delete the duplicate record,
  # "Joel Conway".
