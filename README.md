# Developing

1. Copy `config/secrets.yml.template` to `config/secrets.yml` and add
   the LDAP and Ezid passwords from
   [Secret Server](https://epm.ets.ucsb.edu/SS/login.aspx).

1. Start PostgreSQL and create new database and a user with login
   privileges, then add their names to `secrets.yml`.

1. Add the credentials for Active Directory and campus LDAP (from
   Secret Server) to `secrets.yml`.

1. Add the Ezid test password (if you don’t have it, email them for
   it) to `secrets.yml`.

1. Add the SRU base URL (currently Pegasus, soon Alma) to `secrets.yml`.

1. Ensure Java is installed (`brew cask install java`), and start Solr
   and Fedora with `bin/wrap` (stop them with `bin/unwrap`).

1. Run `bundle install` and `CI=1 bin/rake db:migrate`. (The `CI`
   environment variable disables Marmotta, which we don’t need to run
   locally.)

1. Start redis, then a Resque worker with `CI=1 VERBOSE=1 QUEUE='*' INTERVAL=5 bin/rake resque:work`.

1. Start the Rails server with `CI=1 bin/rails s`.

You can run tests with `make spec`, and HTML documentation by
installing `yardoc` with `gem install yardoc` then running `make
html`.

# Ingesting records

See {file:ingesting.md} and DCE’s wiki:
<https://github.com/curationexperts/alexandria-v2/wiki>

# Caveats

* Reindexing all objects (to an empty solr) requires two passes
  (`2.times { ActiveFedora::Base.reindex_everything }`). This
  situtation is not common. The first pass will guarantee that the
  collections are indexed, and the second pass will index the
  collection name on all the objects. The object indexer looks up the
  collection name from solr for speed.
